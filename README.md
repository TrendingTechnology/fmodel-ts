# fmodel-ts

When you’re developing an information system to automate the activities of the business, you are modeling the business.
The abstractions that you design, the behaviors that you implement, and the UI interactions that you build all reflect
the business — together, they constitute the model of the domain.

## `IOR<Library, Inspiration>`

This project can be used as a library, or as an inspiration, or both. It provides just enough tactical Domain-Driven
Design patterns, optimised for Event Sourcing and CQRS.

The library is fully isolated from the application layer and API-related concerns. It represents a pure 
declaration of the program logic. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language.
